Element1 has the tippy code which works fine, but now I also want to trigger the tippy on element1 when clicking element2."

        questionDescription:"The table below initially creates 5 rows, now I want to delete all rows where the checkbox is selected. To do so I insert a checkbox in cell[0]. The delete button iterates through all rows and should delete all rows with a checked checkbox.It does work, if only one checkbox is selected but seems buggy if multiply rows are checked. I assume the issue appears because the index changes as soon as the first checked row was deleted. Nethertheless how could I achieve a similar behavour without the need to create single delete buttons for each row?"
